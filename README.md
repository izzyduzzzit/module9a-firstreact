# Izarra Villareal CS 81 Javascript Module 9 Assignment 9A: Build Your First React Component

# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description
This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS. I also added a second component to better understand React. I added the ContactCard component.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx
- I also spent some time watching videos re: React, Vite, props, useState, & useEffect to better
  understand what exactly I am doing in addition to the reading. I think it is very cool that once
  you finish with your app build using React you then build it into html and javascript output that
  uses the React code to output DOM manipulating javascript code for the browser to render. I was
  wondering if vite was a web server or if React had to run on a web server to render code. That is
  not the case. React seems very useful, readable, and structured. I enjoy it quite a bit, but the
  coding structure was a bit of a learning curve at first, but makes a lot of sense in the end. :D

## Challenges
I had challenges trying to understand useEffect, but I get it now. I also had a bit of a challenge trying to understand the structural logic of React jsx code, because it was confusing seeing functions
within funcitons and multiple returns, but after some review I understand and think it's a rather cool
way to organize coding for dynamic content. When we build our apps it will use the code to output html and javascript for client side rendering by the browser so we can host on any webserver without needing
to run any kind of react or vite process. It is very cool.
